1. Provide an input to user so he/she can provide a URL to check

1. Provide an input to user so he/she can have a number divided by 2
2. Create a function divide_by_two() that takes 1 positional argument number1 and prints the output of number1/2
3. If the user provides a value that cannot be converted to integer, print "Value is not a valid number"
4. Try to call the function 3 times with different inputs

1. Create a list cities with values = Prague, Brno, Ostrava, Plzen
2. Provide an input to user so he/she can check whether there is a specific city in the list

1. Create a function "calculator" with 3 positional arguments: number1, number2, operation
return a result of operation:
	- if operation == "sum" then number1+number2
	- if operation == "multiply then number1+number2
	- if operation == "divide" then number1/number2
	- else: None
2. Handle: TypeError and ZeroDivisionError
3. Try to call the function with these values: 2,0,"modulo"

1. From module datetime import class datetime
2. Create a function check_day() with no arguments
3. Inside of this function:
	- create variable weekday using datetime.now().isoweekday()
	- if weekday >5 print "You can stay home" otherwise "Let's go to work"
4. Call the function

1. Create a class Employee()
	- attributes: department (string),health_check (bool), id(int)
	- method:
		- call_it_sick (prints "I need a sick-day")
		- call_it_ready (prints "Ready to start new position") - this one will be printed immediately when a new instance of 
		this class is created
2. Create instances: veronika,marco, jana (with proper parameters)
3. Change marco's department to "c-level"
